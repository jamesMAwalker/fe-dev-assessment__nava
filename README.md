# README | **Nava Frontend Assessment - James Walker**

### Tech

For this assessment I chose to use React with Vite and SCSS. It seemed appropriate to keep things light and fast, but also close enough to the metal so that we can work with the code unencumbered by any extra abstraction introduced by meta-frameworks, or CSS libraries.

### Approach

My approach to the build followed suit with the tooling I chose. I did my best to keep things easy to understand - abstracting where it made sense, but erring on the side of clarity.

### Design

As regards the design, I did my best to reproduce the mockup faithfully. However, I did add a remove button to each of the cards, as well as a modal dialog for creating new users. Iâ€™m not sure why these actions were missing, so my question for the design team would be about how/where a user would perform them, if at all.
